1. fork or download this stuff
2. make sure you got npm installed, then run npm install to download the necessary modules
3. npm run, then try to open localhost:3000/player and localhost:3000/master on two tabs. If something doesn't work, good luck.
4. work on the resources folder. You'll guess what to do.
5. host everything on a server. I recommend fly.io, a nodejs hosting service with a good free plan for small projects
6. when everything seems to work on your pc, your last goal is to open the player view on your dm screen screen. What I did: bought a raspberry pi with a small hdmi screen and set a cronjob to exec a command, to open a chrome tab in kiosk mode with the player view. I'll write here what you have to exactly do later, because it's been very annoying to do and even more annoying it is to connect again to the thing and open the script. bye
