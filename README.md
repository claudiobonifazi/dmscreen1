1- fork or download this stuff
2- make sure you got npm installed, then run npm install to download the necessary modules
3- npm run, then try to open localhost:3000/player and localhost:3000/master on two tabs. If something doesn't work, good luck.
4- work on the resources folder. You'll guess what to do.
5- host everything on a server. I recommend fly.io, a nodejs hosting service with a good free plan for small projects
